## Author: Iok Weng Chan

### Project objective
This project aims to uncover relationships between light exposure history and human behaviours, by applying the statistical methods ANOVA, linear mixed models, and Random Forest models onto experimental data.

### Project Structure
The project is conducted using RStudio 4.4. The data and analyses are organized as follows:
- **data:**
  This is the directory for all data files.

    This folder contains all the original datasets used in this projecct, which were obtained from the private GitHub repository https://github.com/neuroTom/melanopsin-IRL-Iok. The datasets are listed below:
    -**bt_cognitive_variables.RData:** Contains variables related to cognitive task performances.
    -**bt_kss.RData:** Contains KSS (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) scores.
    -**bt_baseline.RData:** Contains questionnaire answers of subjects.
    -**spectrawear_long.RData:** Contains the light exposure measures, including the \alpha-opic EDI, throughout the experiment.
